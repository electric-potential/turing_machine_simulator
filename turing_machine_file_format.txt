state template:
	state: name of state (no spaces)
	accept 0 is do not halt, 1 is accept, 2 is reject
	start: 0 if state is not start state, 1 if state is start state	

delta template:
	state: name of state (no spaces)
	read: single character being read from tape
	write: single character being written to tape
	move: 0 for left, 1 for right
	new state: name of state to transition to

for example, the following turing machine will reject any 
input string that isnt solely 1's and 0's, but it will 
convert each 0 to an a, and each 1 to a b, then accept 
when it hits the end of the string. 

[
	state: accept
	accept: 1
	start: 0
]

[
	state: reject
	accept: 2
	start: 0
]

[
	state: start
	accept: 0
	start: 1
]
